# ✅ ALL ISSUES FIXED - Website Fully Functional!

## Problems Fixed

### 1. ❌ Admin Dashboard Error → ✅ FIXED
**Error:** "Undefined array key 'donations_count'"

**Root Cause:** The `DashboardController` was using undefined array keys and variable names that didn't match the view.

**Solution:**
- Updated `app/Http/Controllers/Admin/DashboardController.php`
- Fixed `$stats` array to include all required keys: `donations_count`, `programs_count`, `volunteers_count`, `posts_count`
- Changed variable names from snake_case to camelCase to match the view
- Removed references to undefined model scopes (like `successful()`, `pending()`, `published()`)

**Test:** Login at http://localhost:8000/admin/login
